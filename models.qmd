## What is the predicted Field Goal Percentage of the Chicago Bulls for the 2023-2024 NBA Season, given that each player has played more than 30 games?

To answer this question, I filtered the data, selecting all the players of the Chicago Bulls that have played more than 30 games. Using this data, I then created a fitted model, using the Field Goal Percentage of each player as the parameter:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(rstanarm)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
NBA_Data_1 <- read_csv("data/NBA-2022-2023-Data.csv", col_types = cols(
  Player = col_character(),
  Team = col_character(),
  Positions = col_character()
  )
) |> 
  filter(Team == "CHI") |>
    filter(`GP` > 30) |>
      select(`Player`, `FG%`, Positions)

new_row <- tibble(Player = "JeVon Carter", `FG%` = 0.423, Positions = "PG,SG")
NBA_Data <- add_row(NBA_Data_1, .before = 1, !!!new_row)
```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
fit_obj <- stan_glm(data = NBA_Data, 
                    formula = `FG%` ~ 1, 
                    family = gaussian, 
                    refresh = 0,
                    seed = 9)

fit_obj
```

This fitted model of the data was then used to create the posterior estimated prediction model. The Posterior Estimated Prediction model calculates the predicted value based on the data the model was given:

```{r}

newobs <- tibble(.rows = 1)

pe1 <- posterior_epred(object = fit_obj, newdata = newobs)

pe <- pe1 |> as_tibble()

pe

```

```{r}
# Calculates the 95% confidence interval, using the quantile() function
confidence_interval <- quantile(pe1, c(0.025, 0.975))
```

All of the values above are predicted values of the Chicago Bulls' 2023-2024 Field Goal Percentage. Taking the average of these values reveals the most accurate prediction, which is 48.7%. This means that the predicted Field Goal Percentage of the Chicago Bulls for the 2023-2024 NBA Season is 48.7%, given that each player has played more than 30 games during the season.

## However...

There is a level of uncertainty associated to this result. Since the predicted percentage was derived from a series of predicted values, it is uncertain whether the predicted field goal percentage will hold true for the 2023-2024 NBA Season. Because of this, I have calculated a confidence interval using the formula below:

```{r fig.width=100, fig.height=100}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("image-folder/formula.png")

```

With 95% confidence, the Chicago Bulls predicted Field Goal Percentage for the 2023-2024 NBA Season is between **45.8%** and **51.8%**.
