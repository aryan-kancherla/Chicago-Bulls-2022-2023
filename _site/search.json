    "text": "The Chicago Bulls had a great season this year, qualifying for the NBA Play-In Tournament and eliminating the Toronto Raptors. The following data was pulled from FantasyPros, a website that provides fantasy sports data & content. Then, the data was filtered to look at the statistics of all the Chicago Bulls players. Finally, I created a Bayesian Prediction Model estimating the Field Goal Percentage of the Chicago Bulls Team. For the 2023-2024 NBA Season, the Chicago Bulls’ predicted average field goal percentage is 49.2%, represented by the dotted black line on the histogram."

I believe this result to be accurate as Nikola Vucevic has played a significant amount of minutes (2746 to be exact) during the 2022-2023 NBA Season. Also, Vucevic’s position (Center) requires him to take frequent layups, dunks, and mid-range shots, validating his FG%."

    "text": "I used an NBA 2022-2023 Player Statistics data set for this project, which I found through FantasyPros, a website that provides fantasy sports data & content.\nBefore creating my model, I had to clean the data first. I filtered the data set, analyzing only the NBA players from the Chicago Bulls. Upon examining this newly filtered data, I noticed a couple of outliers: some of the Chicago Bulls players hardly played any games in the 2022-2023 NBA season, due to injuries, 2-way contracts, etc.. By removing these outliers, the data would be more accurate. After removing the outliers, I created my fitted model, which I used to create the histogram."
