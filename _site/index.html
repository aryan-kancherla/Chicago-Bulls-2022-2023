<p>The Chicago Bulls had a great season this year, qualifying for the NBA Play-In Tournament and eliminating the Toronto Raptors. The following data was pulled from FantasyPros, a website that provides fantasy sports data &amp; content. Then, the data was filtered to look at the statistics of all the Chicago Bulls players. Finally, I created a Bayesian Prediction Model estimating the Field Goal Percentage of the Chicago Bulls Team. For the 2023-2024 NBA Season, the Chicago Bullsâ€™ estimated average field goal percentage is 49.2%, represented by the dotted black line on the histogram.</p>
